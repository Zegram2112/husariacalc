## About The Project

I started this project while reading the awesome [Learn You A Haskell for Great Good!](http://www.learnyouahaskell.com)
book, which has a section on Reverse Polish Notation calculators. I thought
that it would be cool to work on that concept as a method to learn
Haskell, so Husaria was born, named after the polish winged hussars.
